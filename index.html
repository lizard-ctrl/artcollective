                    <p>(collective) is a semester-long class where participants will generate art + discuss work with their peers in a collaborative space.
<br>
                        the class will work in two halves, the first half going off of weekly prompts to get us in the groove of creating, and the second half planning and working towards a long-form project to showcase in a group show at the end of the class. the "weekly" section will be very casual and playful, experimentation is encourages and prompts will be supplemented with suggested reading. the "longform" part will consist of us choosing an overarching theme for the show together, and then working methodically on our pieces, bringing in progress each week and critiquing, until we are ready to share our work in a gallery setting.
                        <br>
                        final note, a range of mediums are encouraged, work with what you are comfortable with or go out of your comfort zone, whatever feels right for each prompt or project!</p>
